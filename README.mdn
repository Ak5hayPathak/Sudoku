<h1> Sudoku Game (Java Swing) </h1>

A fully functional **Sudoku game** built using **Java Swing**, featuring five difficulty levels, real-time validation, an undo/redo system, and the ability to save and load game progress in JSON format.  
The project follows a modular, event-driven architecture with a clear separation between the **core logic**, **UI components**, and **data persistence** layers.

---

## Features

- **5 Difficulty Levels** — Generates Sudoku puzzles ranging from *Easy* to *Expert* using custom digging logic.  
- **Undo / Redo System** — Tracks user moves using the `Move` class to enable reversible actions.  
- **Dynamic Board Interaction** — Real-time updates and cell validation via event listeners.  
- **Save & Load Progress** — Stores and retrieves puzzles from JSON files for persistent gameplay.  
- **Custom Swing UI** — Structured panels (`BoardPanel`, `MenuPanel`, `LevelPanel`, etc.) ensure clean organization.  
- **Interactive Buttons** — Includes hover and click effects through custom button classes.  
- **Event-Driven Design** — Implements `BoardChangeListener` to synchronize logic and interface.  
- **Separation of Concerns** — Clear distinction between *game logic*, *UI elements*, and *I/O operations*.

### `core/` — Game Logic Layer
Defines the main data structures and algorithms that drive the Sudoku logic.

- **`Cell`** – Represents a single cell in the Sudoku grid.
- **`Board`** – Manages the 9×9 grid, rules, and interactions between cells.
- **`Move`** – Tracks user actions for undo/redo operations.
- **`SudokuGenerator`** – Creates Sudoku puzzles at different difficulty levels.

---

### `frame/` — Main Application Window
- **`SudokuFrame`** – The central game window, managing layout and transitions between panels.

---

### `panels/` — UI Components
Encapsulates modular Swing panels representing different parts of the user interface.

- **`BoardPanel`** – Displays and manages the Sudoku grid.
- **`LevelPanel`** – Handles difficulty selection.
- **`MenuPanel`** – Main menu interface for starting or resuming games.
- **`OperatorsPanel`** – Provides operational controls (undo, redo, hint, etc.).

---

### `buttons/` — Custom Buttons
Contains reusable, styled button classes for consistent interaction design.

- **`DifficultyButton`** – Buttons for selecting difficulty levels.
- **`OperationsButton`** – Handles game-related actions like check, clear, or new puzzle.

---

### `io/` — Save & Load System
- **`SaveNLoad`** – Handles serialization and deserialization of the game board in JSON format.

---

### `listener/` — Event Handling
- **`BoardChangeListener`** – Custom interface to track board updates and trigger UI refreshes.

---

### `app/` — Application Entry Point
- **`App`** – The main launcher class that initializes and runs the Sudoku game.
